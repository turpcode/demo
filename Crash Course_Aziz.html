            Climate is the long-term weather pattern in a region, typically averaged over 30 years.[1][2] More rigorously, it is the mean and variability of meteorological variables over a time spanning from months to millions of years. <strong>Some of the meteorological variables that are commonly measured are temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, and precipitation.</strong>Some of the meteorological variables that are commonly measured are temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, and precipitation. In a broader sense, climate is the state of the components of the climate system, including the atmosphere, hydrosphere, cryosphere, lithosphere and biosphere and the interactions between them.[1] The climate of a location is affected by its latitude, longitude, terrain, altitude, land use and nearby water bodies and their currents.[3]

            Climates can be classified according to the average and typical variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. <strong><em>The most widely used classification scheme was the Köppen climate classification.</em></strong>The most widely used classification scheme was the Köppen climate classification. The Thornthwaite system,[4] <a href="https://www.google.com/">in use since 1948</a>in use since 1948, incorporates evapotranspiration along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying biological diversity and how climate change affects it. Finally, the Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region.

            Climate characterizes the average weather conditions for a particular location over a long period of time. WMO actively coordinates the study of the climate, its variations, extremes and change over the past, present and the future. In close collaboration with user agencies, WMO also supports the study of climate impacts on a variety of socio-economic sectors to support evidence-based decision-making on how to best to manage the risks of climate variability and adapt to a changing climate, to ensure human safety and well-being.
